        "answer2":"Usé p5.js para trabajar en la parte visual del juego. Los sprites de animación para Airi y los fantasmas se dibujaron en una aplicación para iPad llamada [Pixaki](https://rizer.co/pixaki/) y luego se integraron en el código [p5.play](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/). Principalmente utilicé ejemplos en p5.play como referencia.\n\nPara el fondo de desplazamiento sin fin, encontré un [chjno](https://editor.p5js.org/chjno/sketches/ByZlypKWM). Establecí una condición para que cada vez que se detectara la palabra \"pew\" o un clic del mouse, la velocidad de desplazamiento cambiara para crear una ilusión de Airi volando hacia arriba. Cuando el usuario no hace nada, la velocidad de desplazamiento es negativa, hace que parezca que Airi se está cayendo.\n\n Para el reconocimiento de sonido, utilicé [Google's Teachable Machine 2](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/io19) (actualmente, hay una versión beta que aún no está disponible en público, ¡pero lo estará muy pronto!). Agregué alrededor de 120 muestras de mis compañeros de clase diciendo la palabra \"pew\" con diferentes entonaciones y 80 muestras de ruido de fondo para entrenarlo.

Este proyecto fue difícil en diferentes niveles y quería comenzar identificando las razones principales por las que es más difícil para alguien como mi madre aprender a programar, principalmente debido a la falta de recursos educativos gratuitos de programación creativa. La mayoría de los recursos gratuitos para aprender la programación creativa no están disponibles en China. Los tutoriales de p5.js en YouTube, así como las cuentas de p5.js en Twitter e Instagram son inaccesibles en China debido a la censura del internet. \n\n Aprendí mucho de los videos de YouTube, como el [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/), pero cuanto más miraba los tutoriales de programación en línea, más me daba cuenta de lo difícil que es encontrar otras mujeres y personas de color enseñando programación, especialmente en mandarín. Quería ayudar a otras mujeres chinas a relacionarse con la programación creativa. \n\n Estoy trabajando para abrir los canales de video a otrxs creativxs chinxs que quieran contribuir al recurso educativo juntxs, como entrevistas y tutoriales invitadxs.

Al final, decidí usar mi teléfono para grabar y iMovie para editar. Espero alentar a otros a que no se necesitan muchas cosas costosas para comenzar a hacer videos instructivos. \n\n Otro problema que encontré fue mi propio miedo a ponerme en línea. Primero tuve que superar mi ansiedad de cometer errores en los videos o recibir comentarios negativos en línea. A menudo, mujeres y personas de color son víctimas de acoso en línea. Espero ayudar a establecer un ejemplo para otras mujeres y personas de color que está bien ponerse en línea y fortalecer sus comunidades compartiendo su conocimiento.

Mi amigo Pedro me introdujo a Processing cuando estudiaba diseño gráfico, y me impresionó. La idea de crear mis propias herramientas para crear gráficos y arte interactivo despertó mi interés, pero una vez que lo intenté, me enganché.

Afortunadamente, hubo algunos ejemplos muy bien documentados en GitHub por Adam Ferriss. Nuestro objetivo era hacerlo de manera que un principiante pueda entender cómo implementarlo, por lo que fue tanto un desafío técnico como un desafío en la enseñanza del código a extraños y principiantes.

Every stream I would launch the p5.js web editor, look at the reference to see if something caught my eye, and demoed it live to my viewers.

I find that the mainstream tech and academic community aren't too kind to people, especially BIPOC, who make a mistake or are incorrect about something so there's an expectation to know everything. My family put an unhealthy amount of pressure on me to be the very best and I come from a high achieving high school and college, so I correlated failing with deep shame. Streaming is different than uploading a prerecorded video as there's no way to edit out your mistakes so I felt the pressure to be completely perfect and kept together.\n\nWhen I first started streaming I was so tense and I felt like I was walking on eggshells because I just didn't want to screw up, not even by a little. It wasn't fun. I reflected on why I wanted to create this stream - a beginner friendly and relaxed place to code creatively. Not making mistakes was simply unrealistic and went against the intended theming and mood of my streams, so I accepted making mistakes, being wrong, and having three tabs of the p5.js reference open on my browser. I also made it clear to my viewers that it's not the quality of the code that matters, it's the output that the code creates because gorgeous code and ugly code have the same value if what they output is the same.

        "answer3": "Fui inspirado por (el único y gran) Daniel Shiffman y su tutorial en cómo crear un laberinto en p5.js (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4). Visitando New York por primera vez, me vi rodeado de una vibrante escena de citas que la ciudad ofrece. Por esto, quise crear un juego basado en amor que le ayude a la gente a abrirse, a explorar con mayor profundidad que las usuales preguntas de Tinder, y para que puedan entender su compatibilidad mientras colaboran.\n\np5.js fue tremendamente útil al permitirme visualizar el laberinto a partir de un arreglo de objetos, y conformar un laberinto 2D con diferentes secciones, cada una individualizada en cuanto a color y a su condición de ser una \"encrucijada\". Usando las curvas de Bezier de p5.js, pude dibujar un corazón en el medio del laberinto que visualiza la distancia entre les jugadores. Como el corazón es actualizado en cada cuadro, parece que está realmente latiendo, y haciéndose más grande mientras les jugadores se van acercando. Además, p5.js provee una manera fácil de limitar la tasa de refresco de cuadros (a diferencia de JavaScript a secas), que usé para limitarla a 24 cuadros por segundo y así asegurar que el juego funcionara similarmente en distintos dispositivos.\n\nDespués de crear el laberinto, tuve que ubicar aleatoriamente \"obstáculo\" en el laberinto; sin embargo, para prevenir que el algoritmo aleatorio los pusiera muy cerca de los callejones sin salida del laberinto, tuve que resolver el laberinto aleatorio y ubicarlos solamente en las vías que conectan a la gente jugandor. ¡Afortunadamente, mi primera lección en recursión me ayudó! Un resolvedor de laberitnos basado en métodos recursivos asegura que ambos jugadores tengan que responder todas las preguntas antes de encontrarse y con la otra persona.",
        "answer4": "My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope). This, coupled with the map functions, has allowed me to create new interface for making arts with mobile devices that extends beyond touching and swiping.",
        "answer5": "Integrating a p5.js canvas a HTML page with other DOM elements proved to be quite cumbersome and error-prone. I had to pay close attention to setting the right z-index, position (absolute), elements' widths and heights to ensure a seamless integration of p5.js with other DOMs into a one-page web game.",
        "answer6": "I mostly use p5.js for 2D projects; however, when it comes to 3D and WebXR, I find A-Frame.js framework extremely easy to learn and versatile to use. A-Frame.js really reminds me of p5.js as both are accessible to creative artists who do not necessarily have technical background on computer graphic.",

      "answer3": "I have been wanting to experiment with music, and I decided to learn how to use p5.sound. I watched Daniel Shiffman's tutorial on using amplitude to visualize sound, and then also watched his tutorial on using frequency. I scoured Free Music Archive to find the perfect soundtrack, that also allowed derivative work in its license, and finally found a great track. Upon experimenting, I found that visualizing frequency has a much more satisfying visual, as every beat you hear, you can see! \nOne change that made a BIG difference to the output was the smoothing! I wasn't clear on what exactly it meant, but when I saw it in the tutorial and tried 0.9 smoothing, it looked amazing! Every time the song is paused, the ripples slowly fade back to 0 and that I really loved that effect. Once this was figured out, I worked on the look and feel of the album art, decided what fonts I wanted to use for the text, and the final colors.

I used the array values, beginShape and endShape to create the circle, but it did not end up being a circle. The values were more than 360 (degrees), and it took me some time to figure out how to fix it. The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn't get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle.

How could I convert them to 'local coordinates' ?

I had to consider this problem, and I finally decided to draw only the last calculated \"line parts\" and keep the rest as it was on the previous update (each time draw is called, I draw just a little more).

      "answer3": "I used p5 to render the moveable character around the screen, and also generate the black and white pixels that are used as a depth map for rendering magic eye images (autostereograms). What is notable with this project is that I was able to make moving magic eye images! I had only seen one GIF of a shark that rotated, and wanted to make a game render out of it. I leveraged the awesome library MagicEye.js created by Ian Pearce to turn the black and white p5 sketch into a magic eye image, and im doing that for each frame, at makes the autostereogram move thats something I had never seen before.",

      "answer5": "I hit a roadblock with trying to get the pixel data from the p5's html5 canvas, so I could feed it into the MagicEye.js library, which turned out not to be so simple. The break though was when I figured out that I could export each frame of the canvas as a image, and feed the raw image into the MagicEye library, it's a hack that actually worked! Although it's really slow it does the job.",
