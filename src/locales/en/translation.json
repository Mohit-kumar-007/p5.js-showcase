        "answer2":"I used p5.js to work on the visual part of the game. The animation sprites for Airi and the ghosts were drawn on an iPad app called [Pixaki](https://rizer.co/pixaki/) and then integrated into [p5.play](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) code. I mainly used examples at p5.play as a reference.\n\nFor the endless scrolling background, I found a p5 sketch by [chjno](https://editor.p5js.org/chjno/sketches/ByZlypKWM). I set a condition so whenever the word \"pew\" or a mouse click was detected, the scrolling speed would change to make an illusion of Airi flying up. When the user does not do anything, the scrolling speed is negative, which makes it look like Airi is falling down.\n\nFor sound recognition, I used [Google's Teachable Machine 2](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/io19) (currently, there is a beta version not available in public yet, but it will be very soon!). I added around 120 samples of my classmates saying the word \"pew\" with different intonations and 80 samples of background noise to train it. Then I integrated the model into the game with [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/).",
        "answer3":"I really love how easily you can create, manipulate, and delete HTML blocks and classes with the p5.js library via [createDiv()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createDiv), [addClass()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Element/addClass) etc. But my most favorite function is [draw()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/draw), since this is where you create magic.",

I was also watching [Dan Shiffman’s matter.js tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bLh3T_4wtrmVHOrOEM1ig_), so I thought why not combine the two and practice what I was learning?",

I am still not happy with all my decisions. But in general, it was helpful to search the forum and not to forget to break down problems into smaller ones and iterate little by little. Also, I had issues with rendering out video files directly out of p5.js. Screen recording was not an option because of intermittent frame rate drops (my laptop is pretty slow). After doing some research, I decided to learn some basics of [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and build a tool for myself.",

                    "answer2":"This project started with an idea of teaching my mom, who lives in China and doesn’t speak English, to code with p5.js. This project was difficult on multiple levels, and I wanted to start by identifying the main reasons why it’s more challenging for someone like my mother to learn to code—primarily due to the lack of free creative coding education resources. Most of the free resources to learn creative coding are unavailable in China. The p5.js tutorials on YouTube as well as the p5.js Twitter and Instagram accounts are inaccessible in China because of internet censorship. \n\n I learned a lot from YouTube videos such as the [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/), but the more I watched coding tutorials online, the more I realized how difficult it is to find other womxn and people of color teaching coding, especially in Mandarin. I wanted to help other Chinese womxn relate to creative coding. \n\n I am working on opening up the video channels to other Chinese creatives who want to contribute to the educational resource together, like interviews and guest tutorials.

In the end, I decided on using my phone to record and iMovie to edit. I hope to encourage others that it doesn’t take a lot of expensive gears to get started making instructional videos. \n\n Another issue I came across was my own fear of putting myself online. I first had to get over my anxiety of making mistakes in the videos or receiving negative comments online. Often womxn and people of color are targets for online harassment. I’m hoping to help set an example for other womxn and people of color that it’s ok to put yourselves online and strengthen your communities by sharing your knowledge.

I was introduced to Processing by my friend Pedro while I was studying graphic design, and it blew my mind. The idea of making my own tools for creating graphics and interactive art piqued my interest, but once I actually tried it, I was hooked. The first project I can remember was an eye that followed you around the screen, and it was sad when you left it alone. \n\n Louise: I initially learned p5.js to make a website I was creating more playful. I’m a C# programmer, so this was a good segway into JavaScript for me.",

Then I heard about a grant for open source, storytelling, and learning resource projects at ITP called [xStory](https://www.itpxstory.com/). Since I wasn't finding much in the way of p5.js + shader documentation, I decided to figure out how they're implemented in p5.js and create a resource for others to learn. When I told Louise about the project, she was immediately excited about learning and teaching shaders in p5.js. She's been great about making sure the project is a learning resource and not just a collection of examples.",

                    "answer4":"Casey: The beginning of the project (figuring out how things work) was us reaching out to amazing people, asking questions, and asking for permission to use their examples in our project. [Adam Ferriss' GitHub](https://github.com/aferriss/p5jsShaderExamples) repo really laid the groundwork for us in understanding how shaders work in p5.js and provided a framework of approachable examples for us to build on. For some specific p5.js-related issues we were having, we reached out to [Kate Hollenbach](http://www.katehollenbach.com/) and [Stalgia Grigg](https://stalgiagrigg.name/) (who worked on the [WebGL implementation in p5.js](https://github.com/Processing/p5.js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+webgl+label%3Aarea%3Awebgl), and they were super helpful. \n\n Louise: The learning curve was pretty steep for getting shaders into p5. Luckily, there were some very well-documented examples on GitHub by Adam Ferriss. Our aim was to do so in a way that a complete beginner can understand how to implement it, so it was as much a technical challenge as it was a challenge in teaching code to strangers and beginners. Here we drew inspiration from the way the [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/foreword.html) book is written. A fun \"hey, it’s not hard and you can do it too\" approach is what we believe in.",

        "answer3": "I tried to make this project as p5-centered as possible, including the DOM manipulation (I did some of the DOM creation using p5, rather than the normal JS). I used the built-in animation loop of p5 to make the shape move through the years. For the circular shapes, I followed the class-based pattern that I learnt from watching The Coding Train videos. I also learnt about Perlin noise from there (https://youtu.be/Qf4dIN99e2w?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bgPNQAdxQZpJuJCjeOr7VD ), and used it both for the ‘veil’ and for the movement of the circles.

        "answer4": "From the start, my favourite thing about p5 was the built-in animation loop in the draw() function. It has really helped me wrap my head around animation. I have also started playing with the sound capabilities of p5.sound – it makes a topic that I had no idea how to approach actually straightforward. Also, the built-in Perlin noise and the image capabilities.",
        "answer5": "Yes! I was a beginner when I started this project, and I felt that I learnt a lot from doing it. There are still some bits that I didn’t manage to iron out, mostly to do with responsiveness. I struggled with figuring out how to ‘escape’ the animation loop, where I wanted the ‘veil’ around the circles to keep expanding over time, while the circles updated with the timeline. I found a solution in creating a background behind just the shapes and updating that on each animation loop, essentially erasing the circles, while keeping the ‘veil’.",

And nothing is more abstract than our languages, which we have accepted as granted; unquestioning the complexity of operations that relates the mental structure expressing the semantic content of utterance to its physical realization.

This deepening augments the capabilities of these systems, but, as a consequence, also raises the number of calculations or decision iterations. These increments, in the number of iterations, give way to an increasing statistical complexity in the decision-making process, turning these systems into black boxes.  Perceptron Explanator is an interactive visualization that reveals the accumulated decision iterations of the most elementary system of an artificial neural network: a perceptron. It explains the decision-making progress, revealing the causality present in the process, while freeing the observer from the statistical complexity intrinsic to the algorithm. This visualization aims to help develop an intuition about the inner workings of the perceptron to non-specialists, to everyone.

        "description": "Holos is a generative design platform that explores Benford's law in different sets of data.",
        "extradesc": "Is there a way to measure harmony of the surrounding processes? The universe is mathematically accurate. This is why statistics depicting natural processes are usually distributed according to Benford's law and indicate the harmony of these phenomena. Benford's law is like a lie detector that can check the validity of data. Holos project explores applicability of Benford’s law in various spheres of human activity and natural processes, revealing the beauty of harmonic mathematical world order. Each digit corresponds to a specific musical note that in combination creates unique sound of real time data. Holos offers real time data visualisations of daily earthquakes, covid-19 data, stock market prices and land area by countries. You can also create data visualisation and check its validity by entering random numbers Yourself.",

        "answer2": "I started watching Coding Train tutorials from scratch and used some ideas for my personal project.",
        "answer3": "All platform is based on p5.js library. I am using 4 different API's  that are integrated into the code  for data visualization. All data is interpreted and regrouped according to the Benford's law digit distribution. Main aim was to reveal the beauty of numbers and proof that Benford's law is applicable to various data sets. Leading digits are analysed and grouped according to its value. Each digit has a specific sound so statistical data in whole gain unique melody, that differs every time you run it.",
        "answer4": "I guess the transformation of flat objects into 3D using WEBGL.",
        "answer5": "The project itself was a great challenge for me as I am not a programmer. However, Dan Shiffman works some wonders with his Coding train tutorials, as I managed to extract and apply very useful information about p5.js functions. Without Coding Train I guess my project could never be completed.",
        "answer6": "Benford's law and the way all natural processes in our universe apply to it.",
