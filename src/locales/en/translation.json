        "answer2":"I used p5.js to work on the visual part of the game. The animation sprites for Airi and the ghosts were drawn on an iPad app called [Pixaki](https://rizer.co/pixaki/) and then integrated into [p5.play](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) code. I mainly used examples at p5.play as a reference.\n\nFor the endless scrolling background, I found a p5 sketch by [chjno](https://editor.p5js.org/chjno/sketches/ByZlypKWM). I set a condition so whenever the word \"pew\" or a mouse click was detected, the scrolling speed would change to make an illusion of Airi flying up. When the user does not do anything, the scrolling speed is negative, which makes it look like Airi is falling down.\n\nFor sound recognition, I used [Google's Teachable Machine 2](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/io19) (currently, there is a beta version not available in public yet, but it will be very soon!). I added around 120 samples of my classmates saying the word \"pew\" with different intonations and 80 samples of background noise to train it. Then I integrated the model into the game with [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/).",
        "answer3":"I really love how easily you can create, manipulate, and delete HTML blocks and classes with the p5.js library via [createDiv()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createDiv), [addClass()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Element/addClass) etc. But my most favorite function is [draw()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/draw), since this is where you create magic.",

I was also watching [Dan Shiffman’s matter.js tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bLh3T_4wtrmVHOrOEM1ig_), so I thought why not combine the two and practice what I was learning?",

I am still not happy with all my decisions. But in general, it was helpful to search the forum and not to forget to break down problems into smaller ones and iterate little by little. Also, I had issues with rendering out video files directly out of p5.js. Screen recording was not an option because of intermittent frame rate drops (my laptop is pretty slow). After doing some research, I decided to learn some basics of [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and build a tool for myself.",

                    "answer2":"This project started with an idea of teaching my mom, who lives in China and doesn’t speak English, to code with p5.js. This project was difficult on multiple levels, and I wanted to start by identifying the main reasons why it’s more challenging for someone like my mother to learn to code—primarily due to the lack of free creative coding education resources. Most of the free resources to learn creative coding are unavailable in China. The p5.js tutorials on YouTube as well as the p5.js Twitter and Instagram accounts are inaccessible in China because of internet censorship. \n\n I learned a lot from YouTube videos such as the [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/), but the more I watched coding tutorials online, the more I realized how difficult it is to find other womxn and people of color teaching coding, especially in Mandarin. I wanted to help other Chinese womxn relate to creative coding. \n\n I am working on opening up the video channels to other Chinese creatives who want to contribute to the educational resource together, like interviews and guest tutorials.

In the end, I decided on using my phone to record and iMovie to edit. I hope to encourage others that it doesn’t take a lot of expensive gears to get started making instructional videos. \n\n Another issue I came across was my own fear of putting myself online. I first had to get over my anxiety of making mistakes in the videos or receiving negative comments online. Often womxn and people of color are targets for online harassment. I’m hoping to help set an example for other womxn and people of color that it’s ok to put yourselves online and strengthen your communities by sharing your knowledge.

I was introduced to Processing by my friend Pedro while I was studying graphic design, and it blew my mind. The idea of making my own tools for creating graphics and interactive art piqued my interest, but once I actually tried it, I was hooked. The first project I can remember was an eye that followed you around the screen, and it was sad when you left it alone. \n\n Louise: I initially learned p5.js to make a website I was creating more playful.

Since I wasn't finding much in the way of p5.js + shader documentation, I decided to figure out how they're implemented in p5.js and create a resource for others to learn.

For some specific p5.js-related issues we were having, we reached out to [Kate Hollenbach](http://www.katehollenbach.com/) and [Stalgia Grigg](https://stalgiagrigg.name/) (who worked on the [WebGL implementation in p5.js](https://github.com/Processing/p5.js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+webgl+label%3Aarea%3Awebgl), and they were super helpful. \n\n Louise: The learning curve was pretty steep for getting shaders into p5. Luckily, there were some very well-documented examples on GitHub by Adam Ferriss. Our aim was to do so in a way that a complete beginner can understand how to implement it, so it was as much a technical challenge as it was a challenge in teaching code to strangers and beginners. Here we drew inspiration from the way the [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/foreword.html) book is written.

I find that the mainstream tech and academic community aren't too kind to people, especially BIPOC, who make a mistake or are incorrect about something so there's an expectation to know everything. My family put an unhealthy amount of pressure on me to be the very best and I come from a high achieving high school and college, so I correlated failing with deep shame. Streaming is different than uploading a prerecorded video as there's no way to edit out your mistakes so I felt the pressure to be completely perfect and kept together.\n\nWhen I first started streaming I was so tense and I felt like I was walking on eggshells because I just didn't want to screw up, not even by a little. It wasn't fun. I reflected on why I wanted to create this stream - a beginner friendly and relaxed place to code creatively. Not making mistakes was simply unrealistic and went against the intended theming and mood of my streams, so I accepted making mistakes, being wrong, and having three tabs of the p5.js reference open on my browser. I also made it clear to my viewers that it's not the quality of the code that matters, it's the output that the code creates because gorgeous code and ugly code have the same value if what they output is the same.

Thus, I wanted to create a love game that allows people to open up, to dig deeper than the usual Tinder date questions, and to test each other's compatibility while performing teamwork.\n\np5.js proved tremendously useful in allowing me to visualize the maze from an array of objects to a 2D maze filled with different tiles, each of which can be individualized with regards to its color and whether or not it contains a \"roadblock\". By using p5.js' Bezier curves, I was also able to draw a heart in the middle of the maze that visualizes the distance between the two player. As the heart is updated every frame, it looks like it is actually beating, getting bigger as the two players inching closer to one another. Also, p5.js provided an easier way to limit the frame rate (compared to plain JavaScript), which I set to 24 to ensure that the game runs equally well across different devices.\n\nAfter creating the maze, I had to randomly put \"roadblocks\" along the maze; however, to prevent the random algorithm from putting them near the maze's dead-ends, I had to solve the randomly-generated maze and spread them over the paths that leads one player to the other. Thankfully, my first lesson in recursion came in and saved the day! A maze solver based on recursive method ensures the two players have to answer all the questions before reaching one another.",
      "answer4": "My favorite feature of p5.js is its ease of reading sensor information from smartphones (for example, accelerometer and gyroscope).

I watched Daniel Shiffman's tutorial on using amplitude to visualize sound, and then also watched his tutorial on using frequency. I scoured Free Music Archive to find the perfect soundtrack, that also allowed derivative work in its license, and finally found a great track. Upon experimenting, I found that visualizing frequency has a much more satisfying visual, as every beat you hear, you can see! \nOne change that made a BIG difference to the output was the smoothing! I wasn't clear on what exactly it meant, but when I saw it in the tutorial and tried 0.9 smoothing, it looked amazing! Every time the song is paused, the ripples slowly fade back to 0 and that I really loved that effect. Once this was figured out, I worked on the look and feel of the album art, decided what fonts I wanted to use for the text, and the final colors.

The frequency array can only have length of power of 2, so suppose 256, 512, etc. I couldn't get a length of 360, so instead I made the length 512, and used only the first 360 values from the array to create the circle.

I developed this project as an example of the custom library I'm currently building, based on p5.js, called [pSEngine] (https://github.com/mecanicascience/PhysicsSimulationEngine) that allows you to build your own physics and maths simulations easly.",
      "answer2": "The first time I heard about p5.js was when I first read the book 'The Nature Of Code' by Daniel Shiffman. I wanted to learn a new programming language (at the time, I only knew Processing and Java) that runs on the web. That's why I started learning p5.js, by simply copying and modifying the examples of the book I mentionned earlier.",

      "answer5": "The first difficulty I had can be seen as really obvious but was in fact really challenging because p5.js uses pixel coordinates to draw on the screen. How could I convert them to 'local coordinates' ? (At the end I used real meters as units).\nThat's how and why I finally decided to create a full library that does that (and many more) that... well, you guessed it, was called pSEngine.\nI also had problems with performances, as you will see on the simulation, I have to draw a looooot of lines each time the draw function is called, and the simulation was very laggy. I had to consider this problem, and I finally decided to draw only the last calculated \"line parts\" and keep the rest as it was on the previous update (each time draw is called, I draw just a little more). That's why the simulation must be restarted each time you change your windows size.",

Stephanie is a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania with an interest in neuroscience and computer science and is eager to learn more about the interdisciplinary ties between these two fields, having participated in coding workshops through premier programs at LinkedIn and Google. Alex is a freshman at the University of British Columbia studying computer engineering with an interest in cybersecurity, web development, and language design. Sashrika is a freshman at the University of California, Berkeley majoring in computer science and interested in learning more about the applications of tech, having had experience as a research assistant at the University of Iowa and through freelance web development.",
      "answer2": "While we all had different backgrounds in computer science and its applications, we mainly explored p5.js as students at Google's Computer Science Summer Institute, where we learned to implement programming fundamentals in a variety of projects. From learning how to use import statements to implementing the p5 collision library to modeling games like Frogger, we were quickly able to grasp how to use our problem solving knowledge to create interactive games and displays through JavaScript. As we transitioned from moving static polygons across a screen to utilizing objects and classes in our projects, we learned to integrate our understanding of JavaScript in more complex and interesting solutions.",
      "answer3": "Our project consists of a landing page and two games, both created using p5.js, and a statistics activity page where users can track their progress over time. The two games, a mental math and periodic table trainer, were built using JavaScript and HTML so that we could access related libraries and resources. The statistics page handles data using Firebase and was built using Bootstrap CSS. All authentication, hosting, and data persistence is also handled through Firebase.",

What is notable with this project is that I was able to make moving magic eye images! I had only seen one GIF of a shark that rotated, and wanted to make a game render out of it. I leveraged the awesome library MagicEye.js created by Ian Pearce to turn the black and white p5 sketch into a magic eye image, and im doing that for each frame, at makes the autostereogram move thats something I had never seen before.",

These increments, in the number of iterations, give way to an increasing statistical complexity in the decision-making process, turning these systems into black boxes.  Perceptron Explanator is an interactive visualization that reveals the accumulated decision iterations of the most elementary system of an artificial neural network: a perceptron. It explains the decision-making progress, revealing the causality present in the process, while freeing the observer from the statistical complexity intrinsic to the algorithm. This visualization aims to help develop an intuition about the inner workings of the perceptron to non-specialists, to everyone.
