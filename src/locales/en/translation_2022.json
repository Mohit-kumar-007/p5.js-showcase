I'd also like to thank my wonderful mentors Sam Vassor, KT Duffy, and Ashley Kang for all their (emotional and technical) support and words of wisdom. Finally I'd like to thank Lauren McCarthy, Saber Khan, Qianqian Ye, evelyn masso, Connie Liu, Jiwon Shin and the p5 maintainers and contributors for helping me with this project and being a part of the start of my open source journey 💗",
  "Answer1": "The p5.js Showcase is an online gallery of work created with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), an open source creative computing library. It was created by [Ashley Kang](https://ashleykang.dev) in 2019 ([view the 2019 Showcase here](https://p5js.org/showcase/)), previously curated by [Connie Liu](https://connieliu0.github.io), and currently maintained by [Katie Chan](https://katiechan.cargo.site/). \n \n The purpose of the Showcase is to celebrate how people are using and learning p5.js to make creative work with the aim of conveying our core values of inclusivity.",
  "Answer2": "Usually the p5.js will open up a call for submissions via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/p5xjs) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p5xjs/)!

I also learnt about Perlin noise from there (https://youtu.be/Qf4dIN99e2w?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bgPNQAdxQZpJuJCjeOr7VD ), and used it both for the ‘veil’ and for the movement of the circles.

There are still some bits that I didn’t manage to iron out, mostly to do with responsiveness. I struggled with figuring out how to ‘escape’ the animation loop, where I wanted the ‘veil’ around the circles to keep expanding over time, while the circles updated with the timeline. I found a solution in creating a background behind just the shapes and updating that on each animation loop, essentially erasing the circles, while keeping the ‘veil’.",

I'm currently making an animation film to go with an (inter)net.art work I made called 'Classic Gold Premium': all part of my Kone foundation funded PhD artistic research project, which situates the growth of the assisted reproductive technology industry in Europe in the context of intensified migratory control systems and the commercial enclosing of the internet.",
      "answer2": "I started using processing for video mapping in 2016 at Hangar.org in Barcelona, then I experimented with processing  for transforming images into sound in 2017 for Criticaldías video project \"Calling the Magician\".  I took a course at Aalto uni early 2020, which was about using p5.js specifically to write basic drawing software.",

      "answer5": "There was a couple of basic things I had to learn for this tool to work: how to make it so the user can save and download their image as a jpg  / how to make sure the 'ink' didn't disappear so learning about mousepressed function / aesthetically I enjoyed searching for a line colour that is the closest to terracotta, which is the kind of local clay that is most abundant in Barcelona, where this project started.",
      "answer6": "I hope this isn't too self-promotional, but I  have some processing inspired (not p5.js though....) poems in my first poetry collection :) \nhttps://blackspringpressgroup.com/products/valid-virtual-vegetable-reality-by-rebecca-close",

Sound - I personally composed and recorded guitar riffs and used p5.sound to add trimmed sections that would play on a keypress along with a visual\n2.

      "extradesc": "How will the next generation learn creative coding? Do they have to look up hundreds of pages of documentation and take classes? Do they have to write redundant code for features already well accomplished due to lack of information? Do they have to learn English? b5 rethinks the future of creative coding in terms of clarity, accessibility, and customizability in a world that increasingly emphasizes remote collaboration, internationalization, and personalized learning. b5 is a web-based visual programming language for learning and fast prototyping for people with minimal to no programming experience, leveraging novel features compared to other visual programming languages, including (1) position-based sequential execution (blocks are executed in order based on their positions in the code canvas), (2) customized blocks (users can use the predefined blocks and the graphical interface to design and construct new blocks), and (3) effect blocks (block that affects other code blocks based on their contextual relationship instead of wire connection). b5 makes programming easy to learn and encourages programmers to explore and try, while more analysis is needed to assess its usability and long-term effects when used as the learning platform for beginners.
